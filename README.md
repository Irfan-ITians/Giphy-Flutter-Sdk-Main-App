# GIPHY SDK for Flutter

The fastest and easiest way to bring the full GIPHY experience directly to your app is with the GIPHY SDK. Built with developers and product designers in mind, GIPHY SDK is a top-to-bottom solution for all things GIF in your app. Introducing support for the Flutter developer ecosystem, this project enables you to easily integrate our battle-tested native [iOS](https://github.com/Giphy/giphy-ios-sdk) and [Android](https://github.com/Giphy/giphy-ios-sdk) SDKs, which handle everything from interfacing with the GIPHY API, fetching and caching assets, and displaying GIFs and Stickers on screen in customizable UI templates.

With billions of requests a day, it’s safe to say GIPHY knows GIFs. We're excited to share our best-in-class tools with you so your users can have the best GIF experience possible, with all the same features they're already enjoying on Facebook, Slack, Instagram, and more – with just a few lines of code.
